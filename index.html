            I'm Kate — currently a freelance photographer and writer, now
            an aspiring front end developer based in London. Welcome to my

            My background is as varied as my interests: I graduated in 2015 with
            a degree in linguistics and teaching English as a second language. Before
            that I did a foundation degree at UAL in Art and Design. Since graduation,
            I worked as a customer service rep at a dog food startup before becoming
            office manager there and at another fast-growth startup.

            My lifelong hobbies have included photography, drawing and painting, and
            writing. I've loved coffee for as long as I've been allowed to drink it
            and have variously worked as a barista and also as a coffee journalist
            (it's a thing!) I also love travelling, and recently discovered a passion
            for snowboarding. Down time is great too, though, so I also enjoy reading
            and doing yoga.

            I've always been much more of a 'right-brain' person, enjoying
            writing, drawing, photography, and other creative pursuits.
            I always figured that I wasn't necessarily very good at things
            that required a certain kind of logical, rational thinking, such
            as mathematics or coding.
          </p>
          &nbsp;
          <p>
            However, since moving to London and becoming involved in the tech/
            startup scenes, coding is <i>everywhere</i>. It's the foundation
            of it all, and therefore hard to ignore. In fact, it irked me
            to have such a blind spot - to work in these circles and not know
            anything about how the companies I was involved with were created from
            scratch.
          </p>
          &nbsp;
          <p>
            More than that, I began to see the connection to 'right-brain' creativity
            and imagination. Could I learn to build things from the ground up as well
            by focusing on this blind spot I had and overcoming those challenges? I
            love learning new things, and I was curious and eager for this challenge.

            After many abandoned attempts to learn coding in my spare time — on
            evenings and weekends, already drained from my full time job, with no
            true pressure to force me to progress — I went fully 'freelance' in
            February 2018 to take the plunge and find out once and for all if the
            coding life could be for me.
          </p>
          &nbsp;
          <p>
            This time, I've been amazed and humbled to see the kind of progress I've
            been able to make with the help of resources like FreeCodeCamp, Codecademy, the Founders
            and Coders meetups, Codebar, Codewars, and more. I now feel competent in
            being able to build things from scratch using all three.
          </p>
          &nbsp;
          <p>
            I'm looking forward to continuing this journey, wherever that may be,
            and learning even more so I can confidently call myself a full stack
            front-end developer and create the things I want to see in the world.
