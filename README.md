## What's all this then?

Well, it seems you've found my application page for [Founders and Coders](https://foundersandcoders.com), a nonprofit coding course based in sunny London :sun_with_face: :gb:

My prerequisite journey is almost complete:

- [x] Complete sections on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)
- [x] Reach 5 kyu on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)
- [x] Create a Codewars kata
- [x] Make friends, go to meetups, chat on Gitter
- [x] Brew insane amounts of tea
- [ ] Convince 3 Brits to put milk first when brewing tea
- [ ] Eat something besides a cheese toastie for breakfast this week
- [x] Discover the buzz of creating things from nothing
- [x] Instill a desire to learn more

(A few personal prerequisites _may_ have snuck in there...)

Now all that's left is to dot my `.classes`, `//comment` my stylesheets, and prepare for the real, ongoing journey that is learning to code.

Be sure to check out my page for more information about me, why I'm keen to code, and some relevant links. 

_Until next time - **Kate**_
